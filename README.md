# TBC x USAID 

## Description
This project is a copy of a page from TBC academy. It was developed as part of my participation in the TBC x USAID React program's exam.
## Features
 . I used Flexbox and Grid to make things look good and work well on different screens.
 . Added a cool slider so you can smoothly move through content without any hassle.
 . Created an accordion feature for better organization. It lets you hide or show information as you need.
 . The navigation menu adjusts itself, making it easy to use on both big computer screens and small phone screens.
